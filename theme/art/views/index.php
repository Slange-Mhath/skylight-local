        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-part">
            The University of Edinburgh has been engaged with the practices of commissioning, purchasing and displaying
            the work of artists for nearly 350 years. The early stages of this collecting were closely linked with
            galvanising the institutions identity and status as a place of learning and inspiration, through the
            commissioning and purchase of portraits and busts of Professors and key alumni.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alongside commissioning and displaying work across campus, emphasis is now placed on the use of artworks in
            the support and development of research and teaching.
            <br>
            <br>
            The present day Art Collection is made up of two institutional collections – the University of
            Edinburgh Fine Art Collection & the Edinburgh College of Art Collection.
            <a href="./browse/Collection">Together they are comprised of twelve sub-collections, which you can
                view here.</a>
            <br><br>
            Although figures are not exact because data hasn’t been consistently recorded, estimates are that
            white, western European artists represent the upper 90% of the collection. Around 33% of the overall
            individuals represented in the holdings are women, meaning the majority of works collected were by
            men.
