            <h2>8,000 artworks from almost two millenia.</h2>
            <p class="centered-text">The University of Edinburgh has been engaged with the practices of commissioning,
                purchasing and displaying the work of artists for nearly 350 years, and has amassed a collection of
                around 8,000 artworks spanning a period of almost two millennia.

                    The early stages of this collecting were closely linked with galvanising the institutions identity
                    and status as a place of learning and inspiration. Portraits and sculptural busts of Professors,
                    Ministers and key alumni were accumulated and testified to the Universityâ€™s identity as a powerful
                    Enlightenment institution.

                                Over time, the University began to look to artworks as a means of decoration and
                                adornment for the buildings and campuses constructed as advancements happened in fields
                                of study. This work continues, but a greater emphasis is now placed on the use of
                                artworks in the support and development of research and teaching; both as a means of
                                illustrating complex ideas, or offering up innovative thinking or commentary through the
                                materials or subject matter they employ.

                                We continue to actively acquire and commission works, with the most recent strand of
                                development being the Contemporary Art Research Collection (CARC). Established in 2015
                                in partnership with academics in the History of Art department at ECA, the CARC takes
                                globalisation as its central theme, setting a specific focus on women's experience and
                                the contribution of feminist thought. Artists acquired to date include Alberta Whittle,
                                Shona Mcnaughton, Kate Davis, Melanie Gilligan, and Petra Bauer.

                    <h3>Comissioning</h3>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Commissioning is a practice that involves the engaging of an artist in the production of a new
                        work of art. The collection can offer support and advice to those wishing to commission
                        permanent and temporary art for university buildings, and as part of research. The University of
                        Edinburgh Commissioning Guidelines can be viewed here. Physical copies can be obtained on
                        request.</p>
