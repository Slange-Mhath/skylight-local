                        <p>The University of Edinburgh has been engaged with the practices of
                            commissioning,
                            purchasing and displaying the work of artists for nearly 350 years, and has amassed a
                            collection of
                            around 8,000 artworks spanning a period of almost two millennia.

                The early stages of this collecting were closely linked with galvanising the institutions identity
                and status as a place of learning and inspiration. Portraits and sculptural busts of Professors,
                Ministers and key alumni were accumulated and testified to the Universityâ€™s identity as a powerful
                Enlightenment institution.

                            Over time, the University began to look to artworks as a means of decoration and
                            adornment for the buildings and campuses constructed as advancements happened in fields
                            of study. This work continues, but a greater emphasis is now placed on the use of
                            artworks in the support and development of research and teaching; both as a means of
                            illustrating complex ideas, or offering up innovative thinking or commentary through the
                            materials or subject matter they employ.

                            We continue to actively acquire and commission works, with the most recent strand of
                            development being the Contemporary Art Research Collection (CARC). Established in 2015
                            in partnership with academics in the History of Art department at ECA, the CARC takes
                            globalisation as its central theme, setting a specific focus on women's experience and
                            the contribution of feminist thought. Artists acquired to date include Alberta Whittle,
                            Shona Mcnaughton, Kate Davis, Melanie Gilligan, and Petra Bauer.
