            The Art Collection is predominantly composed of artworks in fairly traditional materials, such as oil paint,
            marble, and bronze. Divergence from this, and the active collecting of contemporary work, has been a more
            recent endeavour; triggered by the merger of the University with Edinburgh College of Art in 2012.<br><br>
            As with many UK collections brought together in recent centuries, representation in the Art Collection is
            skewed towards white, western European artists, with estimates that they account for over 90% of the
            holdings. Approximately 33% of the individuals represented in the collection are women, meaning the majority
            of artists are men.<br><br>
            This section provides a short introduction to some of the key areas of the Art Collection holdings, both in
            terms of historical significance and future development. It is by no means exhaustive, so for further

                        The Edinburgh College of Art (ECA) Collection is comprised of a diverse range of subjects and
                        genres, including painting, sculpture, film, animation, textiles and jewellery. The largest of
                        the collections is Drawing & Painting, which contains approximately 2,000 items, primarily
                        ex-student work.<br><br>
                        Although work was collected from 1914/1915 onwards, the majority of the items remaining in the
                        collection were produced in the second half of the 20th century. This includes a number of
                        significant formative works by artists such as

                        Parthenon frieze â€“ works donated directly by Lord Elgin especially for the education of artists

                        The Art Collection has also been investing in adding to its modest, but important, selection of
