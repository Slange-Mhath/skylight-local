            Commissioning is a practice that involves the engaging of an artist in the production of a new work of art.
            The University Art Collection can offer support and advice to those wishing to commission permanent and temporary art for University buildings, and as part of research. The University of Edinburgh Commissioning Guidelines can be viewed here, with physical copies available on request.</p>

                <p class="desc-text">Here to Deliver was a live cycle of performances by artist Shona Macnaughton, produced over October and November of 2020.  Footage and audio from the performances will become a new moving image work, set to join the collection in 2021.<br> <br>
                    Responding to research undertaken on artists’ engagement with the ‘gig’ and ‘platform’ economies, the artwork explores the conditions of artistic labour, when actioned through gig economy structures.<br>
